Parameterizable Reproducible Research
-------------------------------------

An example of a useful pattern in R -- wrapping a reproducible research report in an R script 
with an external configuration file.

This demo pulls WMATA Disruption Report data from a public API, then based on the configuration
file, generates a custom PDF report complete with charts and tables.

Thank you to Code for DC for the link to the data on Open Data DC:
